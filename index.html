  <h1>Privacy Policy – FriendLyst</h1>
  <div class="meta">Last updated: August 13, 2025 <br> • Contact: <a href="mailto:support@example.com">reef@fogel.cc</a></div>

  <p>FriendLyst (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is a shared lists app that lets you create groups, add items, and collaborate with friends. This policy explains what we collect, why we collect it, how we use and share it, and the choices you have.</p>

<p>1) Information We Collect
Account & Profile

Nickname and user ID; email address if you sign in with email or Google; optional profile photo.

Content You Create

Groups (lists), items, categories, assignments, comments/notes, and images you upload for groups or your profile.

Device & App Data

Basic device and app info (e.g., OS/version, app version, language, time zone) for functionality and troubleshooting.

Push notification identifiers (Expo/FCM push token) to deliver notifications you opt in to.

Permissions You May Grant

Photos/Media/Camera: to let you upload a group image or profile picture.

Notifications: to receive alerts about invites, requests, or list changes.
We do not collect precise location, contacts, SMS, or microphone data.
</p>
<p>2) How We Use Information
Provide and operate FriendLyst (sync lists and groups, invite friends, assign items).

Send you relevant notifications (e.g., you were added to a group or received a friend request).

Maintain safety and integrity (fraud prevention, abuse mitigation).

Improve reliability and performance (debugging, support).

We do not sell your personal information. We do not use cross-app behavioral advertising. If we introduce ads or new analytics later, we’ll update this policy before enabling them.</p>

<p>3) Legal Bases (EEA/UK users)
Where GDPR/UK GDPR applies, we process data based on:

Contract: to provide the app you requested.

Legitimate interests: e.g., security, troubleshooting, app improvements.

Consent: for optional features like notifications or media access.
</p>
<p>4) Sharing & Disclosure
We share information only with service providers that help us run the app:

Google Firebase (Authentication, Firestore Database, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions).

Expo Push Service / Firebase Cloud Messaging (sending device notifications).
These providers process data on our behalf and under our instructions. We may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and integrity.
</p>
<p>5) Data Storage, Location & Transfers
Data is stored in cloud services that may be located outside your country (e.g., the EU or USA). Where required, we use appropriate safeguards for international transfers (such as standard contractual clauses).
</p>
<p>6) Retention & Deletion
We keep information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the service and comply with legal obligations.
You can request deletion of your account and associated personal data by:

Using the in-app deletion option (if available), or

Emailing us at reef@fogel.cc with your account email/ID.
Push tokens are removed when you disable notifications, log out, or delete your account. Backups may persist for a limited period for disaster recovery.
</p>
<p>7) Your Rights & Choices
Access/Correction/Deletion: You can request a copy, correction, or deletion of your data.

Consent controls: You can revoke permissions (e.g., Photos, Notifications) in your device settings.

EEA/UK: You may have rights to restrict/oppose processing and to data portability. You may lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

California (CCPA/CPRA): We do not “sell” or “share” personal information as defined by the CPRA. You may request access or deletion via reef@fogel.cc.
</p>
<p>8) Security
We use technical and organizational measures to protect data, including encrypted transport (HTTPS) and access controls (e.g., Firebase Security Rules). No method is 100% secure; we work to continually improve safeguards.
</p>
<p>9) Children
FriendLyst is not directed to children under [13/16—choose your threshold]. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided data, contact us to remove it.
</p>
<p>10) Third-Party Links
If the app links to external sites or content, their privacy practices apply; please review their policies.
</p>
<p>11) Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated version with a new “Last updated” date, and take additional steps if required by law.
