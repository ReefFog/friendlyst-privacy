  <h1>Privacy Policy – FriendLyst</h1>
  <div class="meta">Last updated: August 13, 2025 • Contact: <a href="mailto:reef@fogel.cc">reef@fogel.cc</a></div>

  <p>FriendLyst (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is a shared lists app that lets you create groups, add items, and collaborate with friends. This policy explains what we collect, why we collect it, how we use and share it, and the choices you have.</p>

  <h2>1) Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Account &amp; Profile</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Nickname and user ID; email address if you sign in with email or Google; optional profile photo.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Content You Create</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Groups (lists), items, categories, assignments, comments/notes, and images you upload for groups or your profile.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Device &amp; App Data</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic device/app info (e.g., OS/version, app version, language, time zone) for functionality and troubleshooting.</li>
    <li>Push notification identifiers (Expo/FCM push token) to deliver notifications you opt in to.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Permissions You May Grant</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photos/Media/Camera:</strong> to upload a group image or profile picture.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> to receive alerts about invites, requests, or list changes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <em>not</em> collect precise location, contacts, SMS, or microphone data.</p>

  <h2>2) How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and operate FriendLyst (sync lists and groups, invite friends, assign items).</li>
    <li>Send relevant notifications (e.g., you were added to a group or received a friend request).</li>
    <li>Maintain safety and integrity (fraud prevention, abuse mitigation).</li>
    <li>Improve reliability and performance (debugging, support).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information. We do not use cross-app behavioral advertising. If we introduce ads or new analytics later, we’ll update this policy before enabling them.</p>

  <h2>3) Legal Bases (EEA/UK users)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contract:</strong> to provide the app you requested.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> e.g., security, troubleshooting, app improvements.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> for optional features like notifications or media access.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Sharing &amp; Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We share information only with service providers that help us run the app:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> (Authentication, Firestore Database, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions).</li>
    <li><strong>Expo Push Service / Firebase Cloud Messaging</strong> (sending device notifications).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These providers process data on our behalf and under our instructions. We may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and integrity.</p>

  <h2>5) Data Storage, Location &amp; Transfers</h2>
  <p>Data is stored in cloud services that may be located outside your country (e.g., the EU or USA). Where required, we use appropriate safeguards for international transfers (such as standard contractual clauses).</p>

  <h2>6) Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
  <p>We keep information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the service and comply with legal obligations.</p>
  <p>You can request deletion of your account and associated personal data by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using the in-app deletion option (if available), or</li>
    <li>Emailing us at <a href="mailto:reef@fogel.cc">reef@fogel.cc</a> with your account email/ID.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Push tokens are removed when you disable notifications, log out, or delete your account. Backups may persist for a limited period for disaster recovery.</p>

  <h2>7) Your Rights &amp; Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access/Correction/Deletion:</strong> You can request a copy, correction, or deletion of your data.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent controls:</strong> Revoke permissions (e.g., Photos, Notifications) in your device settings.</li>
    <li><strong>EEA/UK:</strong> You may have rights to restrict/oppose processing and to data portability; you may lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.</li>
    <li><strong>California (CCPA/CPRA):</strong> We do not “sell” or “share” personal information as defined by the CPRA. Request access or deletion via <a href="mailto:reef@fogel.cc">reef@fogel.cc</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8) Security</h2>
  <p>We use technical and organizational measures to protect data, including encrypted transport (HTTPS) and access controls (e.g., Firebase Security Rules). No method is 100% secure; we work to continually improve safeguards.</p>

  <h2>9) Children</h2>
  <p>FriendLyst is not directed to children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided data, contact us to remove it.</p>

  <h2>10) Third-Party Links</h2>
  <p>If the app links to external sites or content, their privacy practices apply; please review their policies.</p>

  <h2>11) Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated version with a new “Last updated” date, and take additional steps if required by law.</p>
