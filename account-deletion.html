  <div class="meta">Last updated: August 13, 2025 • Contact: <a href="mailto:reef@fogel.cc">reef@fogel.cc</a></div>

  <h2>How to request deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Send an email to <a href="mailto:reef@fogel.cc?subject=FriendLyst%20Account%20Deletion%20Request&body=Please%20delete%20my%20FriendLyst%20account.%0AEmail%20used%20to%20sign%20in:%20_____%0AUser%20ID%20(if%20available):%20_____%0AI%20understand%20this%20action%20is%20permanent.">reef@fogel.cc</a>
    from the email address associated with your account. If you used a guest sign-in, just log out and your data will be removed automatically.
  </p>

  <h2>What we delete</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Account & profile data (nickname, email if provided, profile photo).</li>
    <li>Account settings and preferences (e.g., notification tokens).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What may remain</h2>
  <p>
    FriendLyst has shared lists. To preserve other members’ data, content inside shared lists may remain available to the group
    (e.g., items or history in lists you participated in). Your membership is removed and any personal identifiers are detached.
    If you want entire lists removed, please delete them before requesting deletion or ask the list owner to remove them.
  </p>

  <h2>Timeline</h2>
  <p>We process requests within <strong>up to 10 days</strong>. You’ll receive a confirmation email when the deletion is completed.</p>

  <h2>Verification</h2>
  <p>For your security, we may ask you to verify ownership (e.g., reply from the registered email or provide the User ID).</p>

  <h2>Backups & logs</h2>
  <p>
    Backups and system logs may retain limited data for a short period for security and disaster recovery. These are routinely purged.
  </p>

  <h2>Irreversibility</h2>
  <p>Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.</p>
